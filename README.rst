Background
----------
This is a package for doing history-augmented MSM (haMSM) analysis on weighted ensemble trajectories.
Weighted ensemble data produced from simulations with recycling boundary conditions are naturally in a directional
ensemble. This means that a history label can be assigned to every trajectory, and an haMSM can be constructed.
This code is based on the methods described in the paper:

Accelerated Estimation of Long-Timescale Kinetics from Weighted Ensemble Simulation via Non-Markovian “Microbin” Analysis

Features
--------
* Compute a history-augmented Markov state model from WESTPA weighted ensemble data
* Estimate steady-state distributions
* Estimate flux profiles
* Estimate committors
* WESTPA plugins to automate haMSM construction
* WESTPA plugin to automate bin+allocation optimization

Example Usage and Analysis with msm_we Package
----------------------------------------------
The example folder contains a demonstration of how to use the msm_we package. The Jupyter notebook, hamsm_construction.ipynb, illustrates how to build the model using WE data stored in the file tests/reference/1000ns_ntl9/west.h5. Additionally, the analysis.ipynb notebook provides examples of various analyses performed on the built model.


Known Issues
------------
- Sometimes, on Python3.7 (and maybe below) the subprocess calls will fail. This may manifest as a silent failure,
  followed by hanging (which is very fun to debug!) To fix this, upgrade to Python 3.8+.

- If running with `$OMP_NUM_THREADS > 1`, Ray parallelism may occasionally silently hang during clustering / fluxmatrix calculations
